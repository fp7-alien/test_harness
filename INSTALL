To build you need to add to your CLASSPATH
$(base_directory)/test_harness
and
$(base_directory)/test_harness/libs/*

e.g.

export TESTHARNESS=/home/richard/code/test_harness
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$TESTHARNESS:$TESTHARNESS/libs/*

build with

ant build

To run with a blank example data it is necessary to do:
java ccntester.testharness.TestHarness scripts/example.xml

The scripts directory contains an example test topology
example.xml controls the test harness
testfile.net contains information about the topology to be connected
